# Store Insider

A utility app with only one purpose - to give you the details which the official store listing doesn't.

To see any app's "Insider" details, open the app listing in the store, click on the "Share" button, and choose this app as the target. The Store Insider app will fetch the latest info about the app, and show you when the app was first released in the Store, and when it was last updated.

If you want more features, face issues, or want to contribute, file an issue on this app's repository.

This app is originally inspired by the WPSnitch web app.
